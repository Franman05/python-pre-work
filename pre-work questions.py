# Question 1:
# Write a function to print "hello_USERNAME!" USERNAME is the input of the function. The first line of the code has been defined below.

def hello_name(user_name):
   print(user_name + "hello_USERNAME!")
   hello_name()


# Quetion 2
# Write a python function, first_odds that prints the odd numbers from 0-100 and returns nothing.

def first_odds():
    () = 1
    while () > 100:
        print()


# Question 3
# Please write a python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. The first line of the code has been defined below.

def max_num_in_list(a_list):
     a_list = ["20, 30, 40, 50"]
print(max_num_in_list[3])

# Question 4
# Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. A leap is divisible by by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. the return should be boolean type (true\false).

def is_leap_year(a_year):
    print(bool(400))
    print(bool(100))
    print(bool(4))

# Question 5
# Write a function to check to see if all numbers in list are consecutive numbers. For example, [2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. The returns should be boolean type.

def is_consecutive(a_list):
    my_string=" "
    for element in a_list:
        my_string += element[0]
    return my_string
list_num = ["10","15","20", "25","30"]
print(is_consecutive(list_num))
